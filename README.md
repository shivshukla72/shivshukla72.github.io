# Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- GSAP ( Implement the parallax effect )
- Slick Carousel ( Implement the slider )

## Project Setup Guidelines
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Make sure you have Bootstrap 5 and jQuery properly linked in your HTML file.
4. Ensure you have Slick Carousel library included for the slider.
5. Customize the SCSS variables in the `_typography.scss` and '_colors.scss' file to match your desired font styles and color scheme.
6. Use a SCSS compiler (e.g., Sass) to compile your SCSS code into CSS.
7. Link the compiled CSS file in your HTML.
8. Run a local server to preview your landing page. You can use live-server, http-server, or any other server of your choice.

## Approach
In this interview project, I built a landing page using HTML, CSS (SCSS), Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript (jQuery). The project includes a slider using the Slick Carousel library and adheres to the BEM naming convention for CSS classes. 

I started by setting up the basic structure of the landing page with HTML and applied the BEM naming convention for CSS classes. This made the project structure more organized and easy to maintain. Bootstrap 5 was used to enhance the layout and responsiveness of the page. I defined variables for font sizes, line heights, font families, and colors in the `_variables.scss` file, which made it easy to maintain a consistent design throughout the project.

I used SCSS mixins for creating reusable button styles and utilized the `rgba` function for specifying colors with transparency. The Slick Carousel library was integrated to create an engaging slider for showcasing content.

What I Liked:
- The use of SCSS made it easy to manage styles and maintain a consistent design.
- Bootstrap 5 simplified layout and responsiveness.

What I Didn't Like:
- The project could have been enhanced with more interactivity and animation effects.

Challenges Faced:
- Implementing the parallax effect on the ultimate brew guide section and manging the section through grid.

## Estimated Time
I estimate that it would take approximately 20-24 hours to complete this test, depending on your familiarity with the technologies and the level of customization you want to achieve.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance with the project. Good luck!
